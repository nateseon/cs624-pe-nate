# Input
Develop a mobile app that presents MSCS course information using React Native's core components. The app must include one arrow function component, a scrollable layout, a TextInput field, internal styling, and a link to the official course catalog.

# Process
The user interface was built in App.js using ScrollView, View, Text, Image, TextInput, and StyleSheet for layout and design. A clickable catalog link was implemented using the Linking module. To keep the structure simple, course sections were written directly within grouped Views rather than using a separate component.

# Output
The app displays correctly on both web and mobile platforms, showing the course catalog link, input field, an image, and three formatted course sections. All functional and visual requirements for the assignment were successfully met.
